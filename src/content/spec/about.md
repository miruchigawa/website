## About Me

Hi, I'm Nanakura, or maybe you could call me Nana. I'm a full-time freelancer. I do not have any interesting things and am always learning something new.

I began my journey in programming maybe around 6 years ago, but I'm not serious about studying programming until I'm in high school. I am trying to learn again from zero.

## My interested things

What I'm interested in is making AI Waifu stuff. Why, I mean, who doesn't want to like waifu stuff who care about you? Yeah, I know this sounds nerdy, but I'm always alone and feel loneliness every time, so this is fine for me.

What I'm doing is I'm always trying like fine-tuning LLM to make the great models for my AI Waifu. I'm not trying to build it from scratch because that will take a lot of time and I don't have any knowledge of doing that (I'm very dumb at mathematics).

## My skill on programming languages

Ah, the programming languages that I've always used and have already learned are: Typescript, Go, Rust, C#, Python, and maybe swift. So, here I don't want to spell JavaScript, but you should know I have any knowledge of using that, but I don't want to use that language.

Go and Rust have great features. I love both those programming languages. For example, Go is great for making backend apps with fast and easy development, and Rust has great memory safety features.

## My hobbies

Hobbies? Erm, maybe reading manga. Btw, I'm always reading romance stuff because that will never happen to me. Nah, I'm kidding \:v. I'm always killing my time by reading manga or watching anime. My favorite anime is "How to raise a boring girlfriend." I'm in love with Megumi Kato. She always takes care of Tomoya, and she really has a great personality. That's why I fell in love with her.

## Any introduction?

Maybe only that. I don't know what should be added here, but if you want to talk to me (like a job, problems with your project, or anything) you can reach out to me on my contract below.
